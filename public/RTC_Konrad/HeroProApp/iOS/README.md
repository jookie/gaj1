#HeroProApp on iOS

I got a Xcode project ported from the HTML5 and JS files using APPERYIO, there is no .ipa, and if i had the .ipa, i cannot publish it without being a "apple developer" that costs 80$, there is no way to install an .ipa on an iphone device without the apple appstore or cydia, which i think is my light at the end of the tunnel. This is pointless.

Obama, get an iphone, they are sooooo secure :)
